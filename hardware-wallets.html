A hardware wallet keeps the private key offline (not stored on a computer) meaning it’s more secure then a wallet on your phone. A hardware wallet can be used to access and manage your cryptocurrency assets through a connected device, such as a computer or smartphone.</p>
<p>Always ensure you purchase from the supplier’s website, and not from Amazon, E-Bay or another third party.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://trezor.io">Trezor</a></b>  - This is a good starter wallet (coming in at about $60 USD or so). The desktop app is quite nice as well but the biggest drawback is that it looks (and feels) pretty cheap with this funny rattling noise.<br><br>
<b><a href="https://www.ledger.com">Ledger</a></b> - Ledger is the staple for all around “Wallet” security. They’re more common in the Web3 space (e.g. NFT storage) but it does serve as a good hardware wallet.</p>
